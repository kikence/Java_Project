# Java_Project
A project on algorithms and data structures 

A Java Project that takes in input a Binary Search Tree (T) and returns an undirected graph defined only by the leaves of the
Binary Search Tree and edges (E) that satisfy the following condition: 
  (u,v) ∈ E if and only if there is a path in T between u and v which number of edges p is
  p ∈ [m,M] where m and M are respectively the minimum and the maximum number of occurrences of an element.
